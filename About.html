	<h2>Some Stuff about Me</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li>I have a Masters Degree in Psychology and am a Limited Licensed Psychologist.</li>
	  <li>I was first chair drummer in 4th and 5th grades.</li>
	  <li>The best way to get me to do anything is to tell me women can't do it..</li>
	  <li>I've worked at <a href="https://www.xerox.com/">Xerox</a>, <a href="http://www.dupont.com/">duPont</a>, and EDS.</li>
	  <li>My favorite car was a 1966 Corvair Monza Convertable.  When I got it, the engine leaked, burned oil, and smoked.  
	  I took the engine apart and replaced all the seals and gaskets on the way back out.  It ran clean until the day I sold it.</li>
	  <li>Now I drive a boring minivan as a good suburban housewife should.</li>
	  <li>I often try to be funny and fail.  I keep trying anyway.</li>
	</ol>
