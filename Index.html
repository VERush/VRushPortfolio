      <p>Welcome to my first website.  I live in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan with Joe, my husband of 31 years, my adult son, Michael, and our cat, Miyu.  
	  Below is a picture of a red 1966 Corvair Monza convretable, which was the my favorite car. The next picture is my cat looking out my back door.  
	  And in case you can't quite make out what she's looking at in the back yard, there's a closer shot in the third picture.
